                    <p>Born in 1999 in South Korea, I spent my childhood in my home country. In 2006, our family moved to the United States where I began my first school year. I spent almost 3 years in U.S. school until the end of 2008 when we moved back to South Korea. Back there, I spent my life as a student in elementary school, middle school and high school until the end of 2015.</p>

                    <p>In February of 2016, our family moved to Istanbul, Turkey where I was spent my school year in an international school. After I graduated school as a senior in mid 2019, I entered Istanbul Technical University as an undergraduate student in Computer and Informatics.</p>
