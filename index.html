    <p>
         I am a graduate student of Istanbul Technical University. After graduating, I pursued for the master degree on Mechanic Engineering in Korean Universty. I am currently working on designing simple machines and basic codings to funciton the machines. Since I was a kid, I always had an interest in designing machines that could be useful in various areas in life. So after I graduated, I decided to choose a career that involves with machines. Nowadays, I spend most of my hours interacting with Arduino and design remotely controlled electronic gadgets such as drones and wheeled vehicles.
